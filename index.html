                  I'm a Product Data Analyst at Octopus Energy Services, working at the intersection of data, technology, and business impact. Over the past few years, I've had the opportunity to work across fintech, retail, and energy sectors, where I've contributed to initiatives that have saved millions of pounds in revenue and solved real operational challenges.

                  What drives me most is making complex technology accessible. I've trained senior leadership teams on tools like Databricks, SQL fundamentals, and dashboard design. My goal isn't just to teach the "how," but to help them make better, faster decisions that impact our customers and the business. It's incredibly rewarding when a report you build helps solve a UK-wide problem within your industry.

                  In 2025, I was selected to attend Octopus Energy's Tech Summit based on the company-wide impact of my work, where I had the opportunity to collaborate with industry leaders and AI experts, sharing innovative ideas and learning from some of the brightest minds in the energy and tech sectors. That same year, I became the youngest representative of Octopus Energy at UKEXA 2025, where we won three awards that night. These moments remind me why I love what I do: creating impact through data, building relationships across teams, and constantly learning.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Looking ahead, I'm motivated to grow into leadership roles where I can scale impact, mentor others, and continue solving problems that matter.

                  My journey began as a Quality Assurance Engineer at Bank of America from 2020 to 2022, where I built a strong foundation in data analysis and product delivery. I then moved to London and worked as a Customer Operations Lead at Sainsbury's between 2022 and 2024, diving deeper into operational analytics and process optimization. Since 2024, I've been with Octopus Energy Services, focusing on driving data-driven decision-making and delivering measurable business impact across the energy sector.
